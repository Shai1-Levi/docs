Node A->API server: am I healthy?
API server-->Node A: No Response


note over Node A: **Check with \nworker peers
Node A->Node C:am I healthy?
Node C->API server:Is Node A healthy?
API server-->Node C:No Response
Node C->Node A: Couldn't Contact API Server

Node A->Node D:am I healthy?
Node D-->Node A: No Response

Node A->Node E:am I healthy?
Node E-->Node A: No Response

note over Node A: **Check with \ncontrol plane \npeers
Node A->Node B:am I healthy?
Node B-->Node A: No Response

Node A->Node F:am I healthy?
Node F-->Node A: No Response

note over Node A:was unable to \ncontact most worker nodes \nand any control-plane peer
