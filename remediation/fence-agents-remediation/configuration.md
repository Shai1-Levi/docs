# Fence Agents Remediation Configuration

Fence Agents Remediation (FAR) operator watches *FenceAgentsRemediation* (or *far*) Custom Resource ([CR](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)).
FAR can run alongside another operator (e.g., Node Health Check Operator [(NHC)](https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator#readme)) or another mechnaisam that trigger FAR by automatically creating far CRs using *FenceAgentsRemediationTemplate* (or *fartemplate*) CR. FAR can also be run as standalone, when far CR is generated manually using an administratorâ€™s help.

## FAR with NHC

NHC needs to be configured to use FAR, thus a user must do the following steps:

* Install FAR and NHC
* Create fartemplate CR
* Create NHC CR to use fartemplate CR accordingly (see [NHC documentation](https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#remediationtemplate)).

<!-- Fence Agents Remediation (FAR) uses a Custom Resource (CR) created by [Node Health Check Operator](https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator#readme) (NHC) based on a FAR's remediation template (*FenceAgentsRemediationTemplate*). -->

## FAR Standalone

Administrator should choose the fence agent based on the cluster platform, and know its parameters for running FAR properly.

* Install FAR
* Create far CR where the CR name should be the node to be remediated

For more on how to confogure and use FAR, please go to its [documentation](https://github.com/medik8s/fence-agents-remediation#usage).
